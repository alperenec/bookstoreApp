## 🔑 Key Focus: Multiple Slice Usage in Redux Toolkit

This project highlights **how to use multiple slices** in Redux Toolkit effectively:

- `bookSlice` manages the list of books and search functionality.
- `formSlice` handles the form state for adding new books.

By using **extraReducers**, `formSlice` resets form values when a book is added, demonstrating cross-slice interaction.
